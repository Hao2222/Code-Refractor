This project is about refracting a webpage to make it more accessible.
The HTML file has been renamed from 'website' to 'Horiseon home page'
All the image links now have alt attributes.
The 'lead generation' box has been moved to align with other blocks on the page.
In the CSS file, the ids and classes are consolidated to make the file less cluttered.
